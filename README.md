# The Golden Swordsman
The Golden Swordsman is a side-scrolling action game, featuring a swordsman who is
controlled by the user. With nothing but a shiny golden sword in his hand, the only option the swordsman has is to move forward and slay the monsters that stand before him. However, he must be careful not to let his health bar reach zero or else he will die. As the user defeats enemies, he can collect coins which can be used to upgrade the swordsmanâ€™s stats, i.e. attack, defense, speed etc. The further the swordsman
ventures, the stronger the monsters get, and the greater the loot they drop.
